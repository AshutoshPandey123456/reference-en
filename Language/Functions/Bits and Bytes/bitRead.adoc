= bitRead()


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS
[#overview]

[float]
=== Description
Reads a bit of a number.
[%hardbreaks]


[float]
=== Syntax
`bitRead(x, n)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`x`: the number from which to read. +
`n`: which bit to read, starting at 0 for the least-significant (rightmost) bit.


[float]
=== Returns
The value of the bit (0 or 1).

--
// OVERVIEW SECTION ENDS
=== Example Code
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code
Reads the bit at the specified position and returns the value. In this example the binary representation of 6 is 0110, since `n=1` the value of the second bit from the right (which is 1 in this case) will be read and printed.

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop() 
{
  int x = 6; int n = 1;       //setting the value of x and n
  Serial.print(bitRead(x,n)); //reading the bit at position n and printing the value
}

[float]
=== Notes and Warnings
The indexing of the rightmost bit starts from 0, so `n=1` reads the second bit from the right.

Both `x` and `n` must be integer type.
